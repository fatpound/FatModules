# FatModules
Please read my main repo's [README.md](https://github.com/fatpound/fatpounds-Delight/blob/main/README.md) first.\
Must be compiled with MSVC v19.39.* using /std:c++20 or /std:c++latest

The #if directives are there just to not break IntelliSense when using the C++20 STD header modules / C++23 STD library modules. Otherwise it won't work. At least IntelliSense has to work properly in Debug configurations, it has to colour the words. Unless?

Even the GitHub's "IntelliSense" stops working with modules :)
